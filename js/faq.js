A month later I was laid off from my job and I started doing it full time. Currently I work full time and stream part time."

I would come back to the game, farm points on doctor for a couple weeks and then quit again. This happened until the Ash vs Evil Dead DLC came out and that sucked me back in and I've been playing regularly ever since."
